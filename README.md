 |**Pros**|
 |:------:| 
 |  1. IntelliSense. It analyzes the semantics (letters) of what you are inputting, as well as the rest of the code you have created, and          then provides suggestions on how to finish what you are writing.|
 |  2. Debugger for Chrome. It allows you to set breakpoints and debug JS from within VSCode.|
 |  3. Git integration.| :thumbsup:
 
   |     **Cons**   |
 |:------:|
 |  1. A large number of configuration settings and options. This can be a bit overwhelming to a new user.|
 |  2. High Learning Curve.|
 |  3. Sometimes it is slow and requires good computers to work.|
